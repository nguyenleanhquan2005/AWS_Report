### Notes and Knowledge Gained in Week 1:

#### 1. Overview of Cloud Computing
* **Definition:** The delivery of IT resources on-demand over the internet, instead of purchasing and managing physical infrastructure yourself.
* **Key Benefits:**
    * **Pay-as-you-go:** Only pay for what you use, helping optimize costs (e.g., shutting down servers at night).
    * **Accelerated Development:** Automation features help deploy applications faster.
    * **Flexible Scalability (Elasticity):** Easily increase/decrease resources (CPU, RAM) according to immediate needs.
    * **Global Deployment:** Leverage provider infrastructure to serve users worldwide within minutes.

#### 2. Real-world Market and Employer Requirements
* **Vietnamese Market:** Cloud workforce demand is very high in both technology companies and traditional industries (banking). Technology adoption is fast, no longer lagging behind the world.
* **Employer Requirements:**
    * **Hands-on Experience:** Certifications are just the starting point. Most important is the ability to build and troubleshoot independently.
    * **Portfolio More Important than CV:** Personal projects, technical blogs, Github source code are more valuable than a CV that just lists items.
    * **Foundational Knowledge:** Must have solid knowledge of networking and operating systems.
    * **Soft Skills:** Communication, teamwork, and English are essential factors.

#### 3. Effective Learning Methods and Community Power
* **Learning Methods:**
    * **Long Journey:** Requires persistence, cannot master in a few months, must continuously learn.
    * **Proactive Problem Solving:** Develop the habit of researching independently before asking.
    * **Learn to "Build":** The ultimate goal is to create products and concrete solutions, not just follow existing labs.
    * **Don't Fear Failure and Investment:** Accept investing time, effort, and small costs for practice.
* **Community Power:**
    * **Supportive Environment:** A place to learn and share knowledge without fear of judgment.
    * **Networking:** Attending events is an opportunity to meet experts and potential employers.
