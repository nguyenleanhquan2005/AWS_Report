Here you can freely share your personal opinions about your experiences participating in the First Cloud Journey program, helping the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following categories:

### General Evaluation

**1. Work Environment**

The work environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always ready to help when I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is neat and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, the constantly changing environment is also a downside for me. Having a fixed number of sessions registered at the beginning of each week would make time management easier.

**2. Mentor / Admin Team Support**

The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don't understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports procedures, documentation, and creates favorable conditions for me to work smoothly. I highly appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and handle problems myself rather than just giving answers.

**3. Alignment Between Work and Major**

The work I was assigned was not quite aligned with the knowledge I learned at school, while also expanding into new areas that were somewhat challenging for me. Thanks to this, I both learned additional practical skills and new skills, while also preparing myself for the future. Learning new things is never redundant.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**

During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared many practical experiences that helped me better orient my career.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**

The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still has fun. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports each other regardless of position. This makes me feel like I'm part of the team, even though I'm just an intern. Because the office schedule is not fixed, I couldn't get to know new friends, except for those in my group.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**

The company provides internship allowances and creates flexible time conditions when necessary. Additionally, being able to participate in internal training sessions is a big plus.

### Other Questions

- What are you **most satisfied with** during your internship?
  - Helping me understand more about cloud. This will be beneficial for my career path in the future.

- What do you think the company **needs to improve** for future interns?
  - I hope future interns will get to work on exercises that are increasingly closer to reality and more aligned with the market. Instead of just doing free projects.

- If recommending to friends, would you **advise them to intern here**? Why?
  - I'm not sure, the environment here is positive but perhaps not suitable for me, but it may be suitable for others.

- Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?
  - **None**

- Would you like to continue this program in the future?
