The technology extends Stable Diffusion and Stable Image models to give you precise control over image creation and editing. Clear prompts are critical—they provide art direction to the AI system. Strong prompts control specific elements like tone, texture, lighting, and composition to create the desired visual outcomes. This capability serves professional needs across product photography, concept, and marketing campaigns.\nIn this post, we expand on the post Understanding prompt engineering: Unlock the creative potential of Stability AI models on AWS. We show how to effectively use advanced prompting techniques to maximize image generation quality and precision for enterprise application using Stability AI Image Services in Amazon Bedrock.\nSolution overview Stability AI Image Services are available as APIs in Amazon Bedrock, featuring capabilities such as, in-painting, style transfer, recoloring, background removal, object removal, style guide, and much more.\nIn the following sections, we first discuss prompt structure for maximum control of image generation, then we provide advanced techniques of prompting for stylistic guidance. Code samples can be found in the following GitHub repository.\nPrerequisites To get started with Stability AI Image Services in Amazon Bedrock, follow the instructions in Getting started with the API to complete the following prerequisites:\nSet up your AWS account. Acquire credentials to grant programmatic access. Attach the Amazon Bedrock permission to an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role. Request access to the Amazon Bedrock models. Structure prompts that maximize control To maximize the granular capabilities of Stability AI Image Services in Amazon Bedrock, you must construct prompts that enable fine-grained control.\nThis section outlines best practices for building effective prompts that produce the desired output. We demonstrate how prompt structure affects results and why more structured prompts typically yield more consistent and controllable outcomes.\nChoose the right prompt type for your use case Selecting the right prompt format helps the model better understand your intent. Three primary prompt formats deliver different levels of control and readability:\nNatural language maximizes readability and is best for general usage Tag-based formats enable precise structural control and are ideal for technical application Hybrid formats combine natural language and the structural elements of tags to provide even more control The following table provides examples of these three common ways to phrase your prompts. Each prompt format has its strengths depending on your goal or the interface you’re using.\nPrompt type Prompt example Generated image using Stable Image Ultra in Amazon Bedrock Description and use case Basic Prompt (Natural Language) “A clean product photo of a perfume bottle on a marble countertop” This is readable and intuitive. Great for exploration, conversational tools, and some model types. Stable Diffusion 3.5 responds best to this style. Tag-Based Prompt “perfume bottle, marble surface, soft light, high quality, product photo” Used in many generation UIs or with models trained on datasets like LAION or Danbooru. Compact and good for stacking details. Hybrid Prompt “perfume bottle on marble counter, soft studio lighting, sharp focus, f/2.8lens” Best of both worlds. Add emphasis with weighting syntax to influence the model’s priorities. Build modular prompts Modular prompting enhances AI image generation effectiveness. This approach divides prompts into distinct components, each specifying what to draw and how it should appear. Modular structures provide several benefits: they help prevent conflicting or confusing instructions, allow for precise output control, and simplify prompt debugging. By isolating individual elements, you can quickly identify and adjust effective or ineffective parts of your prompts. This method ultimately leads to more refined and targeted AI-generated images.\nThe following table provides examples of modular prompt modules. Experiment with different prompt sequences for your desired outcome; for example, placing the style before the subject will give it a more visual weight.\nModule Example Description Prefix “fashion editorial portrait of” Sets the tone and intent for a high-fashion styled portrait Subject “a woman with medium-brown skin and short coiled hair” Gives the model’s look and surface detail to help guide facial features Modifiers “wearing an asymmetrical black mesh top, metallic jewelry” Adds stylized clothing and accessories for visual interest Action “seated with her shoulders angled, eyes locked on camera, one arm lifted” Describes body language and pose to give dynamic composition Environment “bathed in intersecting beams of hard directional light through window slats” Adds context for dramatic light play and atmosphere Style “high-contrast chiaroscuro lighting, sculptural and abstract” Informs the aesthetic and mood (shadow-driven, moody, architectural) Camera/Lighting “shot on 85mm, studio setup, layered shadows and light falling across face and body” Adds technical precision and helps control realism and fidelity The following example illustrates how to use a modular prompt to generate the desired output.\nModular Prompt Generated Image Using Stable Image Ultra in Amazon Bedrock “fashion editorial portrait of a woman with medium-brown skin and short coiled hair, wearing an asymmetrical black mesh top and metallic jewelry, seated with shoulders angled and one arm lifted, eyes locked on camera, bathed in intersecting beams of hard directional light through window slats, layered shadows and highlights sculpting her face and body, high-contrast chiaroscuro lighting, abstract and bold, shot on 85mm in studio” Use negative prompts for polished output prompts improve AI output quality by removing specific visual elements. Explicitly defining what not to include in the prompt guides the model’s output, typically leading to professional outputs. Negative prompts act like a retoucher’s cNegativehecklist used to address aspects of an image to enhance quality and appeal. For example, “No weird hands. No blurry corners. No cartoon filters. Definitely no watermarks.” Negative prompts result in clean, confident, compositions, free of distracting element and distortions.\nThe following table provides examples of additional tokens that can be used in negative prompts.\nArtifact Type Tokens to Use Low quality or noise blurry, lowres, jpeg artifacts, noisy Anatomy or model issues deformed, extra limbs, bad hands, missing fingers Style clashes cartoon, illustration, anime, painting Technical errors watermark, text, signature, overexposed General cleanup ugly, poorly drawn, distortion, worst quality The following example illustrates how a well-structured negative prompt can enhance photorealism.\nWithout Negative Prompt Prompt “(medium full shot) of (charming office cubicle) made of glass material, multiple colors, modern style, space-saving, upholstered seat, patina, gold trim, located in a modern garden, with sleek furniture, stylish decor, bright lighting, comfortable seating, Masterpiece, best quality, raw photo, realistic, very aesthetic, dark “ With Negative Prompt Prompt “(medium full shot) of (charming office cubicle) made of glass material, multiple colors, modern style, space-saving, upholstered seat, patina, gold trim, located in a modern garden, with sleek furniture, stylish decor, bright lighting, comfortable seating, Masterpiece, best quality, raw photo, realistic, very aesthetic, dark” Negative Prompt “cartoon, 3d render, cgi, oversaturated, smooth plastic textures, unreal lighting, artificial, matte surface, painterly, dreamy, glossy finish, digital art, low detail background” Emphasize or suppress elements with prompt weighting Prompt weighting controls the influence of individual elements in AI image generation. These numerical weights prioritize specific prompt components over others. For example, to emphasize the character over the background, you can apply a 1.8 weight to “character” (character: 1.8) and 1.1 to “background” (background: 1.1), which makes sure the model prioritizes character detail while maintaining environmental context. This targeted emphasis produces more precise outputs by minimizing competition between prompt elements and clarifying the model’s priorities.\nThe syntax for prompt weights is (\u0026lt;term\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;weight\u0026gt;). You can also use a shorthand such as ((\u0026lt;term\u0026gt;)), where the number of parentheses represent the weight. Values between 0.0–1.0 deemphasize the term, and values between 1.1–2.0 emphasize the term.For example:\n(term:1.2): Emphasize (term:0.8): Deemphasize ((term)): Shorthand for (term:1.2) (((((((((term))))))))): Shorthand for (term:1.8) The following example shows how prompt weights contribute to the generated output.\nPrompt with weights “editorial product photo of (a translucent gel moisturizer jar:1.4) placed on a (frosted glass pedestal:1.2), surrounded by (dewy pink flower petals:1.1), with soft (diffused lighting:1.3), subtle water droplets, shallow depth of field” Prompt without weights “editorial product photo of a translucent gel moisturizer jar placed on a frosted glass pedestal, surrounded by dewy pink flower petals, with soft, subtle water droplets, shallow depth of field” You can also use weights in negative prompts to reduce how strongly the model avoids something. For example, “(text:0.5), (blurry:0.2), (lowres:0.1).” This tells the model to be especially sure to avoid generating blurry text or low-resolution content.\nGiving specific stylistic guidance Effective prompt writing when using Stability AI Image Services such as Style Transfer and Style Guide requires a good understanding of style matching and reference-driven prompting. These techniques help provide clear stylistic direction for both text-to-image and image-to-image creation.\nImage-to-image style transfer extracts stylistic elements from an input image (control image) and uses it to guide the creation of an output image based on the prompt. Approach writing the prompt as if you’re directing a professional photographer or stylist. Focus on materials, lighting quality, and artistic intention—not just objects. For example, a well-structured prompt might read: “Close-up editorial photo of a translucent green lip gloss tube on crushed iridescent plastic, diffused colored lighting, shallow DOF, high fashion product styling.”\nStyle tag layering: Known aesthetic labels that align with brand identity The art of crafting effective prompts often relies on incorporating established style tags that resonate with familiar visual languages and datasets. By strategically blending terms from recognized aesthetic categories (ranging from editorial photography and analog film to anime, cyberpunk cityscapes, and brutalist structures), creators can guide the AI toward specific visual outcomes that align with their brand identity. These style descriptors serve as powerful anchors in the prompt engineering process. The versatility of these tags extends further through their ability to be combined and weighted, allowing for nuanced control over the final aesthetic. For instance, a skincare brand might blend the clean lines of product photography with dreamy, surreal elements, whereas a tech company could merge brutalist structure with cyberpunk elements for a distinctive visual identity. This approach to style mixing helps creators improve their outputs while maintaining clear ties to recognizable visual genres that resonate with their target audience. The key is understanding how these style tags interact and using their combinations to create unique, yet culturally relevant, visual expressions that serve specific creative or commercial objectives. The following table provides examples of prompts for a desired aesthetic.\nDesired aesthetic Prompt phrases Example use case Retro / Y2K 2000s nostalgia, flash photography, candy tones, harsh lighting Metallic textures, thin fonts, early digital feel. Clean modern neutral tones, soft gradients, minimalist styling, editorial layout Great for wellness or skincare products. Bold streetwear urban background, oversized fit, strong pose, midday shadow Fashion photography and lifestyle ads. Prioritize outfit structure and location cues. Hyperreal surrealism dreamcore lighting, glossy textures, cinematic DOF, surreal shadows Plays well in music, fashion, or alt-culture campaigns. Invoke a named style as a reference Some prompt structures benefit from invoking a named visual signature from a specific artist, especially when combined with your own stylistic phrasing or workflows, as shown in the following example.\nPrompt “editorial studio portrait of a woman with glowing skin in minimalist glam makeup, high-contrast lighting, clean background, (depiction of Van Gogh style:1.3)” The following is a more conceptual example.\nPrompt “product shot of a silver hair oil bottle with soft reflections on curved chrome, (depiction of Wes Anderson style:1.2), under cold studio lighting” These phrases function like calling on a genre; they imply choices around materials, lighting, layout, and color tonality.\nUse reference images to guide style Another useful technique is using a reference image to guide the pose, color, or composition of the output. For use cases like matching a pose from a lookbook image, transferring a color palette from a campaign still, or copying shadowplay from a photo shoot, you can extract and apply structure or style from reference images.\nStability AI Image Services support a variety of image-to-image workflows where you can use a reference image (control image) to guide the output, such as Structure, Sketch, and Style. Tools like ControlNet (a neural network architecture developed by Stability AI that enhances control), IP-Adapter (an image prompt adapter), or clip-based captioning also enable further control when paired with Stability AI models.\nWe will discuss ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and clip-based captioning in a subsequent post.\nThe following is an example of an image-to-image workflow:\nFind a high-quality editorial reference. Use it with a depth, canny, or seg ControlNet to lock a pose. Style with a prompt. Prompt “fashion editorial of a model in layered knitwear, dramatic colored lighting, strong shadows, high ISO texture” Create the right mood with lighting control In a prompt, lighting sets tone, adds dimensionality, and mimics the language of photography. It shouldn’t just be “bright vs. dark.” Lighting is often the style itself, especially for audiences like Gen Z, for instance TikTok, early-aughts flash, harsh backlight, and color gels. The following table provides some useful lighting style prompt terms.\nLighting style Prompt terms Example use case High-contrast studio hard directional light, deep shadows, controlled highlights Beauty, tech, fashion with punchy visuals Soft editorial diffused light, soft shadows, ambient glow, overcast Skincare, fashion, wellness Colored gel lighting blue and pink gel lighting, dramatic color shadows, rim lighting Nightlife, music-adjacent fashion, youth-forward styling Natural bounce golden hour, soft natural light, sun flare, warm tones Outdoors, lifestyle, brand-friendly minimalism Build intent with posing and framing terms Good posing helps products feel aspirational and digital models more dynamic. With AI, you must be intentional. Framing and pose cues help avoid stiffness, anatomical errors, and randomness. The following table provides some useful posing and framing prompt terms.\nPrompt cue Description Tip looking off camera Creates candid or editorial energy Useful for lookbooks or ad pages hands in motion Adds realism and fluidity Avoids awkward, static body posture seated with body turned Adds depth and twist to the torso Reduces symmetry, feels natural shot from low angle Power or status cue Works well for stylized streetwear or product hero shots Example: Putting it all together The following example puts together what we’ve discussed in this post.\nPrompt “studio portrait of a model with platinum hair in metallic cargo pants and a cropped mesh hoodie, seated with legs wide on (acrylic stairs:1.6), magenta and teal gel lighting from left and behind, dramatic contrast, shot on 50mm, streetwear editorial for Gen Z campaign” Negative prompt “blurry, extra limbs, watermark, cartoon, distorted face missing fingers, bad anatomy” Let’s break down the preceding prompt. We direct the look of the subject (platinum hair, metallic clothes), specify their pose (seated wide-legged, confident, unposed), define the environment (acrylic stairs and studio setup, controlled, modern), state the lighting (mixed gel sources, bold stylization), designate the lens (50mm, portrait realism), and lastly detail the purpose (for Gen Z campaign, sets visual and cultural tone). Together, the prompt produces the desired result.\nBest practices and troubleshooting Prompting is rarely a one-and-done task, especially for creative use cases. Most great images come from refining an idea over multiple attempts. Consider the following methodology to iterate over your prompts:\nKeep a prompt log Change one variable at a time Save seeds and base images Use comparison grids Sometimes things go wrong—maybe the model ignores your prompt, or the image looks messy. These issues are common and often quick to fix, and you can get sharper, cleaner, and more intentional outputs with every adjustment. The following table provides useful tips for troubleshooting your prompts.\nProblem Cause of issue How to fix it Style feels random Model is confused or terms are vague Clarify style, add weight, remove conflicts Face gets warped Over-styled or lacks facial cues Add portrait of, headshot, or adjust pose or lighting Image is too dark Lighting not defined Add softbox from left, natural light, or time of day Repetitive poses Same seed or static structure Switch seed or change camera angle or subject action Lacks realism or feels “AI-ish” Wrong tone or artifacts Add negatives like cartoon, digital texture, distorted Conclusion Mastering advanced prompting techniques can turn basic image generation into professional creative outputs.

By using VNC technology and AWS IoT Secure Tunneling, automotive professionals can now connect to remote vehicle displays for a wide array of applications. This capability enables remote diagnostics and troubleshooting, allowing technicians to securely access infotainment systems or instrument cluster displays of vehicles in the field, while engineers can remotely view and interact with advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) displays to help determine the need for debugging and tuning. During over-the-air (OTA) updates, engineers can monitor the progress and status screens remotely to confirm successful deployment. Fleet managers can use this technology to view driver information displays or telematics screens of multiple vehicles to help monitor performance, fuel efficiency, and improve driver behavior. In automotive manufacturing, quality control personnel can benefit from the ability to remotely access and inspect digital displays on vehicles moving through assembly lines. For vehicle testing and development, test engineers can remotely access prototype vehicle displays during road tests or simulations to help enhance safety and efficiency in testing procedures. Beyond these applications, the technology opens up possibilities for various other maintenance and support use cases, including onboard troubleshooting and guided co-browsing experiences, revolutionizing the way automotive professionals interact with and support vehicles in the field.\nOverview of solution This secure connectivity solution makes use of IoT Secure Tunneling to establish bidirectional communication to remote devices over a secure connection that is managed by AWS IoT. The solution uses a client machine with VNC Viewer installed, an intermediary server that acts as a secure local proxy, and an automotive display that you are connecting to.\nFigure 1: Architecture IoT Secure Tunneling components and messages\nPrerequisites For this walkthrough, you should have the following prerequisites:\nAn AWS account A VPC with a private subnet Basic familiarity with Linux commands and AWS IoT services A device to act as your IoT thing (destination) Recommend using a Raspberry Pi 4 VNC server installed and enabled AWS CLI installed and configured AWS IoT secure tunneling local proxy binary A server to act as a proxy relay (source) This can be an EC2 instance or ECS/EKS container AWS CLI installed and configured AWS IoT Secure Tunneling local proxy binary or container A client machine Recommend using either a Windows Bastion host in AWS or a personal computer VNC viewer installed Network connectivity to your proxy relay (source) Walkthrough Setup your Raspberry Pi The first step is to install and enable the VNC server, configure your Raspberry Pi as an IoT thing, and install or build the IoT Secure Tunneling local proxy.\nNote if the Pi does not recognize that it has a display to share, connect it to a monitor.\nInstall VNC server: sudo apt update sudo apt install realvnc-vnc-server Enable VNC server through raspi-config: sudo raspi-config Navigate to \u0026#34;Interface Options\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;VNC\u0026#34; \u0026gt; Enable Set VNC password: vncpasswd Configure your Raspberry Pi as an IoT thing Register your Raspberry Pi as an AWS IoT thing: aws iot create-thing --thing-name raspberry-pi-vnc Create required IoT policies and certificates (see detailed steps in setup instructions): aws iot create-policy \\ --policy-name SecureTunnelingPolicy \\ --policy-document \u0026#39;{ \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;iotsecuretunneling:RotateTunnelAccessToken\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;iotsecuretunneling:SubscribeToTunnel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;iot:Connect\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;iot:Subscribe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; } ] }\u0026#39; Follow the AWS IoT documentation to create and download certificates (here): aws iot create-keys-and-certificate \\ --set-as-active \\ --certificate-pem-outfile certificate_filename.pem \\ --public-key-outfile public_filename.key \\ --private-key-outfile private_filename.key Attach the policy to the certificate: aws iot attach-policy --policy-name SecureTunnelingPolicy --target \u0026lt;certificate-arn\u0026gt; Install and configure the local proxy (instructions can be found AWS IoT Secure Tunneling Local Proxy or in the Setup Local Proxy sections below) Create an IoT secure tunnel From the command line, issue the following AWS CLI command to your account and region where you are deploying your resources: aws iotsecuretunneling open-tunnel \\ --destination-config thingName=raspberry-pi-vnc,services=VNC \\ --region \u0026lt;your-aws-region\u0026gt; The command will return a JSON payload that contains the sourceAccessToken and destinationAccessToken (see documentation here). Note these down for later use. Best practice is to place the source and destination tokens into their own .txt files for easy use. Setup the local proxy using a binary file Within the private subnet, create an EC2 Ubuntu instance and follow the steps from AWS IoT Secure Tunneling Local Proxy to build the local proxy binary. Ensure that you can communicate from the Windows bastion host (described below) or personal device to the EC2 Ubuntu instance over TCP port 5000, and the instance has an IAM Role allowing Systems Manager access.\nConnect into the EC2 Ubuntu instance via AWS Session Manager or SSH. Run the following command from the command line from the directory that : the localproxy binary is located ./localproxy -s 5000 -b 0.0.0.0 -r \u0026lt;your-aws-region\u0026gt; -t \u0026lt;sourceAccessToken\u0026gt; On your Raspberry Pi, run the following command from the command to start the local proxy binary: ./localproxy -d 5000 -b 0.0.0.0 -r \u0026lt;your-aws-region\u0026gt; -t \u0026lt;destinationAccessToken\u0026gt; Setup the local proxy using a container Reference the Docker documentation to install docker before proceeding. The local proxy container can run on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), if desired.\nTo download the container image and run on your EC2 instance, run the following command from the folder where your source token is stored sourceToken.txt. Replace \u0026lt;distro\u0026gt; with the appropriate distribution option for your machine from the list here:\ndocker run -d -it --network=host \\ public.ecr.aws/aws-iot-securetunneling-localproxy/\u0026lt;distro\u0026gt;-bin:amd64-latest \\ --region us-east-1 \\ -s 5000 \\ -c /etc/ssl/certs \\ -t $(cat sourceToken.txt) \\ -b 0.0.0.0 For raspberry Pi, run the following command where your destinationToken is stored destinationToken.txt.

Follow the instructions here. If you are using a personal device, please ensure your EC2 proxy is in a public subnet.\nGet the IP address of the EC2 Ubuntu instance. If using your personal device, make sure this is the public IP address. Open the VNC Viewer application. Create a new connection. For the connection address, use the IP Address of the Ubuntu server and specify the port as 5000 (i.e. 172.31.59.116:5000) If you are using a personal computer, you will need to make sure your Ubuntu server has a public IP and is in a public subnet\nWhen prompted, enter the authentication information (i.e. username and password you setup on the Raspberry Pi for VNC) Cleaning up To help avoid incurring unnecessary future charges, stop using resources that are no longer needed:\nDelete the AWS IoT thing, certificates, and policies you created Close and delete any open tunnels using the AWS IoT console or CLI Stop the VNC server if no longer needed Terminate and delete any EC2 instances or ECS containers created Delete your VPC and VPC resources you created Conclusion In this post, we demonstrated how to establish secure user interface access to an IoT thing using AWS IoT Secure Tunneling and VNC. This solution can be adapted for various automotive, manufacturing, and industrial IoT scenarios where secure direct screen sharing access is crucial. Examples include remote diagnostics of vehicle infotainment systems and real-time monitoring of manufacturing equipment displays. We also shared details on leveraging built-in IoT messaging to automate the setup and teardown of the IoT secure tunnel and local proxy. Furthermore, this blog presented an architecture showcasing how to expand IoT secure tunnel automation with an AWS serverless architecture. This approach helps efficiently manage the creation and termination of IoT secure tunnels across a fleet of IoT things, whether they\u0026rsquo;re connected to vehicle or other displays.

Through years of supporting cutting-edge research institutions, AWS has developed deep expertise in genomics computing, offering solutions that combine high performance with cost efficiency. At the heart of many genomics pipelines lies AWS Batch, a fully managed compute service that, when paired with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Spot Instances, delivers powerful and cost-effective infrastructure for running Nextflow pipelines. By relying on this foundation, researchers can focus on scientific discovery rather than infrastructure management. To further enhance this robust platform, AWS partners with providers of innovative solutions such as MemVerge, an AWS Partner Network (APN) Advanced Technology Partner, whose Memory Machine Batch (MMBatch) technology complements AWS Batch by providing advanced checkpointing capabilities for EC2 Spot Instances. This collaboration exemplifies the AWS commitment to offering customers choice and flexibility in optimizing their research workflows.\nResearch institutes need to be on a constant lookout for how to reduce computational costs. Amazon EC2 Spot Instances are a great option for high-volume, noninteractive scientific workflows. With up to 90 percent cost savings compared to on-demand pricing, Spot Instances are attractive for high-throughput processing on a budget, but by default they are mainly suitable for fault-tolerant workloads because they can be reclaimed at any time if the asking price goes over the offered price.\nHowever, it’s important to understand that Spot Instance cost savings apply to compute time rather than workflow progress. When Spot Instances are reclaimed, running tasks are interrupted, which can result in lost computation time—potentially hours of processing in long-running genomics workflows. While AWS Batch provides automated retry mechanisms for interrupted tasks, frequent Spot Instance reclamations can impact overall job completion times and make per-job costs less predictable. Organizations need to carefully evaluate their time-to-results requirements and implement appropriate strategies to manage these interruptions effectively.\nThis unpredictability has a lot of centers sticking to On-Demand Instances because they can’t risk incomplete analyses or missed deadlines. This experience isn’t unique. Many Nextflow users have encountered the challenges of working with Spot Instances when trying to balance cost-efficiency with reliability in cloud-based genomics workflows.\nIn this post, we look at how MemVerge’s technology can overcome the challenges of interrupted pipelines by enabling pipelines that were interrupted mid task to start from where they left off, regardless of Spot Instance reclaims. We’ll also show how MemVerge’s Batch Viewer and proven best practices empower researchers to visualize their workloads, identify bottlenecks, and apply smart strategies that make their pipelines more efficient, resilient, and cloud-optimized.\nThe trade-off between cost and reliability in EC2 Spot Instances For research teams working under tight budget constraints, Spot Instances offer a compelling proposition—access to the same compute capacity as EC2 On-Demand Instances, but at a fraction of the cost. It’s a powerful way to stretch grant funding, accelerate time to discovery, and process more samples without compromising scientific goals.\nBut using Spot Instances comes with a catch.\nSpot Instances can be reclaimed by AWS with a 2-minute warning, depending on overall demand for capacity. In practice, this means that compute resources can vanish mid task, and long-running processes can fail without warning. Although Nextflow is designed to retry failed tasks, constant interruptions mean rerunning entire processes, increasing total execution time, and wasting already-consumed compute resources.\nEventually, centers shift critical stages of their workflows back to EC2 On-Demand Instances just to gain the reliability required to meet deadlines. While a shift works, it incurs steep cost—undoing the budgetary advantages that first motivated the move to the cloud.\nThis situation reveals a fundamental tension: Using Spot Instances has the potential to provide a steep discount for compute resources, but it doesn’t necessarily align with the requirements of the compute workflow that is orchestrating the processing power. For bioinformatics workloads that run for hours or days, that mismatch can be costly.\nSo how can research teams continue using EC2 Spot Instances without compromising reliability?\nWithin this ecosystem, MemVerge’s MMBatch serves as a complementary tool, adding transparent, container-level checkpointing to further enhance reliability.\nHow Nextflow helps—but has limits Nextflow is designed to integrate seamlessly with cloud-native execution platforms, and when running on AWS, it hands off task execution to AWS Batch. This decouples workflow logic from the underlying compute layer, enabling AWS Batch to take full responsibility for managing retries, scaling resources, and reacting to Spot Instance reclaims.\nWithin AWS Batch retry strategies are used to control what happens to a job in certain circumstances. Common strategies are to retry the job when the host had an issue—for example, the Spot instance got reclaimed by AWS due to a surge in demand from on-demand customers.\nWhen a Spot Instance is reclaimed, AWS Batch will requeue the job until the maximum number of job attempts are reached (up to 10). From Nextflow’s perspective, the task is simply retried—no manual intervention needed. This approach is elegant because it lets AWS Batch apply cloud-specific strategies and optimizations without burdening the workflow engine. It’s a smart division of labor: Nextflow defines the workflow and AWS Batch handles the execution.\nHowever, although this model improves reliability, it has a critical weakness: By default, every retry starts the job from scratch. The progress made in the previous attempt is usually lost.\nFor short tasks, that’s not a big deal. But for longer-running steps—such as aligning whole genomes or joint-calling across large sample sets—the compute loss can be massive. A task that runs for 6 hours and gets interrupted in hour 5 will still need to restart from the beginning. If Spot Instance reclaims are frequent, the cost and delay multiply rapidly, undermining the budgetary advantage of using Spot Instances in the first place.\nThat’s where MemVerge’s MMBatch steps in to change the game.\nMMBatch doesn’t replace or override AWS Batch—it augments the way containers are launched within AWS Batch compute environments. Once integrated, MMBatch enables checkpointing of running jobs directly at the container level.\nWhen AWS Batch reschedules a job—such as after a Spot Instance reclaim—MMBatch steps in during the container startup phase. Before the job begins executing again, MMBatch checks whether a checkpoint exists. If one is found, it automatically restores the container from that snapshot, picking up from the last saved state rather than starting over. From the AWS Batch perspective, nothing changes; it still sees a job being retried. But now, that retry isn’t a full do-over—it’s a fast recovery.\nThe result is powerful: The compute time already invested isn’t lost, even in the face of Spot Instance evictions. Pipelines become dramatically more resilient, long-running tasks are far less vulnerable, and the economics of Spot Instances become viable again—even for workflows that used to require on-demand reliability.\nVisualizing and optimizing with MMBatch WebUI While checkpointing brings a huge leap in resilience, understanding and optimizing how pipelines behave in the cloud is just as important. That’s where the MMBatch Viewer comes in—a powerful UI that gives researchers and pipeline engineers real-time visibility into their workloads.\nFor many teams, cloud execution can feel like a black box. Tasks run remotely, on some instances, with variable costs and occasional failures. When things go wrong—or even just slower than expected—debugging becomes time-consuming and often guesswork-driven.\nMMBatch WebUI changes that by making the execution layer transparent.\nWith MMBatch WebUI, users can:\nVisualize job timelines to see how long tasks actually take, where retries happen, and how Spot Instance reclaims affect progress. Track checkpoint activity, identifying which jobs benefit from snapshotting and how much compute is being saved. For example, a checkpoint interval of 15 minutes doesn’t checkpoint short running jobs and thus reduces the checkpoint pressure. Analyze cost and efficiency trends, helping teams pinpoint expensive or wasteful stages and refine their resource requests. Diagnose bottlenecks quickly, inspect log files or download a log bundle to open a support ticket. For the genomics research center, this visibility was a turning point. Instead of reacting to failed runs or spiraling costs, they could proactively tune their Nextflow configurations and AWS Batch strategies. They discovered which processes should be prioritized for checkpointing, adjusted memory and vCPU allocations based on real data, and even experimented with instance diversification strategies to reduce Spot Instance reclaim frequency.\nCombined with MemVerge’s checkpointing, MMBatch WebUI helped them transform Spot Instances from a risky gamble into a cost-efficient, high-throughput foundation for their sequencing work.\nMaking EC2 Spot Instances work for you Cloud-scale genomics doesn’t have to mean choosing between cost and reliability. Nextflow and AWS Batch provide a solid foundation—but when EC2 Spot Instance reclaims threaten important deadlines, tools that go beyond retries are needed.\nWith MemVerge’s MMBatch, checkpointing makes even long-running jobs resilient to interruptions. And with the MMBatch WebUI, you gain the visibility and insight needed to tune your workflows for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\nFor research teams running large-scale, time-sensitive workloads, these tools unlock the full potential of EC2 Spot Instances—without the tradeoffs.\nThe AWS advantage in research computing stems from years of experience supporting the world’s most demanding scientific workloads. With global infrastructure offering 99.99 percent availability, continuous innovation in high-performance computing, and deep expertise in genomics workflows, AWS provides the foundation for breakthrough research. Partner solutions like MemVerge’s MMBatch can enhance this foundation, in combination with comprehensive AWS offerings, security capabilities, and cost optimization at scale. As research organizations push the boundaries of scientific discovery, AWS offerings evolve to meet their growing needs, ensuring that technology never becomes a bottleneck to scientific progress.\nDiscover how your team can run faster, spend smarter, and hit every deadline—no matter how complex the science.\nIf you’re ready to dive deeper:\nWatch our walkthrough demo to see MemVerge in action.

Executive Summary The Document QA system is a serverless application designed to revolutionize how users interact with documents. By leveraging AWS Bedrock for Generative AI and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology, the platform allows users to upload PDF/TXT documents and ask natural language questions. The system provides accurate, context-aware answers by retrieving relevant information from the uploaded documents, significantly reducing manual search time and improving information accessibility.\n2. Problem Statement What\u0026rsquo;s the Problem? Traditional document search methods (keyword matching) often fail to capture context or semantic meaning. Manual document review is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially for large volumes of text. Users struggle to extract specific insights quickly, leading to productivity bottlenecks.\nThe Solution We propose a Serverless RAG-based Chatbot using AWS Bedrock (Amazon Titan). The solution involves:\nUpload \u0026amp; Processing: Users upload documents to S3; Lambda functions trigger text extraction and embedding generation. Vector Search: Embeddings are stored and queried to find relevant document chunks. Generative AI: AWS Bedrock generates natural language responses based on the retrieved context. Serverless Architecture: Built on AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB for automatic scaling and cost efficiency. Benefits and Return on Investment Efficiency: Reduces document analysis time from hours to seconds. Accuracy: RAG ensures answers are grounded in the provided document, minimizing hallucinations. Cost-Effective: Serverless pay-as-you-go model (estimated \u0026lt; $5/month for low usage). Scalability: Automatically handles varying loads without manual infrastructure management. 3. Solution Architecture The platform employs a modern serverless architecture to ensure scalability, security, and performance.\nAWS Services Used AWS Bedrock: Provides the Foundation Models (Amazon Titan) for embeddings and text generation. AWS Lambda: Serverless compute for handling API requests, document processing, and orchestration. Amazon API Gateway: Manages REST API endpoints for the frontend. Amazon S3: Stores raw uploaded documents and frontend static assets. Amazon DynamoDB: Manages user sessions and chat history. Vector Store: (Implemented via Lambda/Local or dedicated vector DB) Stores document embeddings for semantic search. Component Design Frontend: Hosted on S3 (or Amplify), providing a user-friendly chat interface. API Layer: API Gateway routes requests (/upload, /ask) to Lambda functions. Processing Layer: Lambda handles text extraction, calls Bedrock for embeddings, and performs vector similarity search. AI Layer: AWS Bedrock generates responses using the retrieved context and user query. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases\nPhase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4): Setup AWS environment, Bedrock access, and basic backend logic. Phase 2: API \u0026amp; Security (Weeks 5-7): Develop API Gateway, Lambda functions, and implement CORS/Security. Phase 3: Frontend Development (Weeks 8-11): Build the React/Next.js interface and integrate with APIs. Phase 4: Testing \u0026amp; Deployment (Weeks 12-14): End-to-end testing, optimization, and final deployment. Technical Requirements\nAI Model: Amazon Titan (via Bedrock) for Embeddings and Text Generation. Backend: Node.js/Python on AWS Lambda. Infrastructure as Code: Serverless Framework or AWS CDK. Frontend: React.js / Next.js. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Month 1: Architecture Design, AWS Setup, Backend Core (Upload/Embeddings). Month 2: RAG Implementation, Vector Search Logic, API Development. Month 3: Frontend Integration, UI/UX Polish, Testing, and Launch. 6. Budget Estimation Estimated Monthly Costs (Low-Medium Usage)\nAWS Bedrock (Titan): ~$0 (Free Tier / Low cost per 1k tokens) AWS Lambda: ~$0.20 per 1M requests Amazon S3: ~$0.023 per GB Amazon DynamoDB: ~$0.25 per 1M requests Amazon API Gateway: ~$3.50 per 1M requests Total Estimated: \u0026lt; $5.00 / month\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Hallucinations (AI Errors): Medium Impact, Medium Probability. Cost Overruns: Medium Impact, Low Probability (Serverless). Data Leakage: High Impact, Low Probability. Mitigation Strategies Hallucinations: Strict RAG implementation (grounding answers in context). Cost: Set AWS Budget Alerts and usage quotas. Security: Use Presigned URLs for S3, IAM roles with least privilege. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements Fully automated document analysis pipeline. Sub-second retrieval latency for vector search. Scalable architecture supporting concurrent users. Long-term Value A reusable RAG framework for future knowledge base applications. Significant productivity gains for users needing quick information retrieval. 9.

Internet Gateway: Enables communication between VPC and the internet. NAT Gateway: Allows private subnet instances to access internet without exposing them. CIDR Planning: Choose appropriate CIDR blocks to avoid IP conflicts with on-premises networks. Plan for future growth when allocating subnet ranges. Best Practices: Use private subnets for databases and backend servers. Place load balancers and bastion hosts in public subnets. Implement multiple availability zones for high availability.

Work Environment\nThe work environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always ready to help when I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is neat and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, the constantly changing environment is also a downside for me. Having a fixed number of sessions registered at the beginning of each week would make time management easier.\n2. Mentor / Admin Team Support\nThe mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don\u0026rsquo;t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports procedures, documentation, and creates favorable conditions for me to work smoothly. I highly appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and handle problems myself rather than just giving answers.\n3. Alignment Between Work and Major\nThe work I was assigned was not quite aligned with the knowledge I learned at school, while also expanding into new areas that were somewhat challenging for me. Thanks to this, I both learned additional practical skills and new skills, while also preparing myself for the future. Learning new things is never redundant.\n4. Learning Opportunities \u0026amp; Skill Development\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared many practical experiences that helped me better orient my career.\n5. Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still has fun. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports each other regardless of position. This makes me feel like I\u0026rsquo;m part of the team, even though I\u0026rsquo;m just an intern. Because the office schedule is not fixed, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get to know new friends, except for those in my group.\n6. Policies / Benefits for Interns\nThe company provides internship allowances and creates flexible time conditions when necessary. Additionally, being able to participate in internal training sessions is a big plus.\nOther Questions What are you most satisfied with during your internship?\nHelping me understand more about cloud. This will be beneficial for my career path in the future. What do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?\nI hope future interns will get to work on exercises that are increasingly closer to reality and more aligned with the market. Instead of just doing free projects. If recommending to friends, would you advise them to intern here? Why?\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure, the environment here is positive but perhaps not suitable for me, but it may be suitable for others.
